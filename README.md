# Challenge-02
This Challenge-02 contains the code for a professional portfolio web page. 
Hello! In this challenge I created a professional portfolio to upload my work and showt it to hiring employers. 
In the portfolio I added my name, my profile photo, a paragraph about me, my work in an attractive visual presentation and a contact me section.
To create this portfolio I played around with fonts, colors, flex-box, sizing parameters, hyperlinks, hover actions and media queries. 
Right now the portfolio is still open to changes as I will be adding new features in the future.
